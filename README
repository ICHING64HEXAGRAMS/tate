1. GETTING STARTED

First thing you need to do is run:

If you do not have pyrcc4 on your system, you may need to install the PyQt4-devel package first.

To run Tate from this directory, just do:

  ./tate

If you install Tate on your system, you can run it from any
directory:

  sudo python setup.py install
  tate
